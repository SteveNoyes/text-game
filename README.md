This is a very basic game with only two rooms, but you can expand on it by adding more rooms, items, and puzzles. In this game, you can move between rooms by typing "north" or "south", look around the room by typing "look", and pick up the key by typing "take key". Have fun!


In this version of the game, there are now four rooms: a dark room, a bright room, a hallway, and a library. The hallway has doors to the east and west, while the library has a locked door to the north. You can unlock the door by typing "unlock door" while in the library. Have fun exploring!
